Version 007
~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: 2009-03-30

Note:
 - The DBus interface of DeviceKit-power may be subject to change in future
   versions of this daemon.
 - The experimental devkit-power-gobject library has no API or ABI guarantees.

New Features:
 - Get rid of internal Object and instead use the GObject property system (Richard Hughes)
 - Move the library directory from libdevkit-power to devkit-power-gobject (Richard Hughes)

   this, which is rediculous (Richard Hughes)
 - Require I_KNOW_THE_DEVICEKIT_POWER_API_IS_SUBJECT_TO_CHANGE (Richard Hughes)

Bugfixes:
 - Fix up DBus interface for CVE-2008-4311 (Stanislav Brabec)
 - Fix g-p-m and DeviceKit-power when running with a permissive dbus. Fixes fd#20882 (Frederic Crozat)
 - Remove use of EggObjList, and make the library more sane (Richard Hughes)
 - Fix compile error in dkp-power. Fixes #20749 (Richard Hughes)

~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: 2009-01-23

Bugfixes:
 - Fix the battery capacity calculation. Fixes fd#19165 (Richard Hughes)

 - Check all the power supply fields for valid data (Richard Hughes)

Version 003
~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: 2008-12-09

New Features:
 - Implement the .QoS interface -- still proof of concept (Richard Hughes)

Bugfixes:
 - Enable the low power saving code in DkpHistory (Richard Hughes)
 - Don't keep putting off the profile saving in DkpHistory (Richard Hughes)
 - Allow DeviceKit-power to run with the 'fixed' DBus (Richard Hughes)

Version 002
~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: 2008-11-13

New Features:
 - add in CanSuspend and CanHibernate into API (Richard Hughes)
 - add two new properties, has-history and has-statistics (Richard Hughes)

 - Nuke devkit-power-on-battery for now (David Zeuthen)
 - Don't report negative rate when charging (Richard Hughes)
 - Remove the battery- and line-power- prefix from the device properties (Richard Hughes)
 - Add DkpStatsObj convenience helpers (Richard Hughes)
 - Save the time to full and time to empty too (Richard Hughes)
 - Don't clear the list when we print it (Richard Hughes)
 - Support getting stats from DkpSupply devices (Richard Hughes)
